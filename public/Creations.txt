Personal Project to showcase my passion and expertise in software engineering, while 
presenting my personality as whole.
-Technologies: React, Framer Motion, Javascript, HTML, CSS

I started coding this website with a new design during my Spring 2024 semester at Purdue. With my
internship starting in June, I've had this month of May to finish up, and really enjoyed the
process. This was built using React in JavaScript from create-react-app, of which useState,
useEffect, and useRef for the mouse effect and accordion animations were used. React components was
just the step up from HTML/JS I needed for better extensibility and cleaner code, with vanilla CSS
remaining surprisingly capable and clean.

Software Engineering Class Semester Project
-Technologies: Django Framework (Python), TailwindCSS, HTML, Javascript, SQLite

For my Software Engineering Class Project at Purdue, my team and I built a web application using the
Django framework (Python) and TailwindCSS. Using the Spotify API, users get feedback about their
music taste and recommendations for new music. Where we got the name JudgeMe, however, is the
comparison feature. We added social media features to allow users to compare their music taste
with their friends. My contributions to this project involved creating Django templates for my
teammates such as the playlist UI. The rest of my work was solely focused on the comparison
features. Using research from Spotify on the link between music taste and personality, I developed
an algorithm that uses your the genres of your favorite songs to tell you a little about what your
music taste says about you!

Personal Lot Number Tracking Project
-Technologies: Java/JavaFX, Apache API

Using the experience I got in Java from my Object Oriented Programming class, I wanted to solve a
problem I was facing at my part-time position at Fisher Packing. We were writing all of the lot
numbers of ingredients by hand, so I sped up the process with lot-tracker! This program reads the
lot numbers from the recipe template that was used at Fisher Packing, and automatically fills it out
from lot numbers that were used previously. No need to rewrite!

Object Oriented Programming Final Project
-Technologies: Java/JavaFX

For this project, my team and I developed a full-stack Java application that allowed a user to send
messages in groups. My contributions to this project were primarily the edit and delete
functionalities of the messages, which was great training for client-server development.
