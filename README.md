# My Software Development Portfolio

I built this portfolio with the intention of it being an extension of my resume.
Throughout college, I did a lot of extracurricular work that I believe to show
a well-roundedness. Also, I was exposed to React during my hackathon project, and
ended up really enjoying it, so I thought I'd keep that going.

This website is very minimal, with framer-motion being the only library I used
during development. While I've used tailwind-css before, I found it to make
the code very cluttered a not very readable. I really enjoyed a vanilla CSS
experience, keeping all styling in separate files.
